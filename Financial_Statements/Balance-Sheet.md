## I. Assets
### 1.1 Current Assets
- Assets are resources controlled by a company for the purpose of generating profit. 
- They can be categorized into two groups—current and noncurrent. 
  - Current assets are resources readily convertible to cash within the operating cycle of the company. Major classes of current assets include cash, cash equivalents, receivables, inventories, and prepaid expenses.
  - Long-term (or noncurrent) assets are resources expected to benefit the company for periods beyond the current period. Major long-term assets include
property, plant, equipment, intangibles, investments, and deferred charges.
- **Current assets** include cash and other assets that are convertible to cash, usually within the **operating cycle** of the company.
- **Operating cycle** is the amount of time from commitment of cash for purchases until the collection of cash resulting from sales of goods or services. It is the process by which a company converts cash into short-term assets and back into cash as part of its ongoing operating activities.

- For a manufacturing company, this would entail purchasing raw materials, converting them to finished goods, and then selling and collecting cash from receivables.
- **Cash represents the starting point, and the end point, of the operating cycle**. The operating cycle is used to classify assets (and liabilities) as either current or noncurrent. **Current assets** are expected to be sold, collected, or used within one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer. 
- Typical examples are: 
  - cash, 
  - cash equivalents, 
  - short-term receivables,
  - short-term securities, 
  - inventories, 
  - and prepaid expenses.
- The excess of current assets over current liabilities is called **working capital**
- **Working capital is a double-edged sword—companies need working capital to effectively operate, yet working capital is costly because it must be financed and can entail other operating costs, such as credit losses on accounts receivable and storage and logistics costs for inventories. Many companies attempt to improve profitability and cash flow by reducing investment in current assets through methods such as effective credit underwriting and collection of receivables, and just-in-time inventory management. In addition, companies try to finance a large portion of their current assets through current liabilities, such as accounts payable and accruals, in an attempt to reduce working capital.**


#### 1.1.1 Cash And Cash Equivalents
- **Cash**, the most liquid asset, includes currency available and funds on deposit
- **Cash equivalents** are highly liquid, short-term investments that are readily convertible into cash and so near maturity that they have minimal risk of price changes due to interest rate movements. These investments usually carry maturities of three months or less. **Examples of cash equivalents are short-term treasury bills, commercial paper, and money market funds**. Cash equivalents often serve as temporary repositories of excess cash.
- The concept of **liquidity** is important in financial statement analysis. By liquidity, we mean the amount of cash or cash equivalents the company has on hand and the amount of cash it can raise in a short period of time. Liquidity provides flexibility to take advantage of changing market conditions and to react to strategic actions by competitors.
- Liquidity also relates to the ability of a company to meet its obligations as they mature. Many companies with strong balance sheets (where there exists substantial equity capital in relation to total assets) can still run into serious difficulties because of illiquidity.
- In general, companies in a dynamic industry require increased liquidity to take advantage of opportunities or to react to a quickly changing competitive landscape.
- **To the extent that cash equivalents are invested in equity securities, companies risk a reduction in liquidity should the market value of those investments decline.**


#### 1.1.2 Accounts Receivable
- **Receivables** are amounts due to the company that arise from the sale of products or services, or from advances (loaning of money) to other companies.
- **Accounts receivable** refer to amounts due to the company that arise from sales of products and services.
- **Notes receivable** refer to formal written promises of indebtedness due.
- **```Valuation of Receivables;``` Experience shows that companies do not collect all receivables. While decisions about collectibility can be made at any time, collectibility of receivables as a group is best estimated on the basis of past experience, with suitable allowance for current economy, industry, and debtor conditions. The risk in this analysis is that past experience might not be an adequate predictor of future loss, or that we fail to fully account for current conditions.**
- In practice, companies report receivables at their net realizable **value—total** amount of receivables less an allowance for uncollectible accounts. Management estimates the allowance for uncollectibles based on experience, customer fortunes, economy and industry expectations, and collection policies. **Uncollectible accounts are written off against the allowance (often reported as a deduction from receivables in the balance sheet), and the expected loss is included in current operating expenses**.
- ```Collection Risk;``` Full information to assess collection risk for receivables is not usually included in financial statements. Analysis tools for investigating collectibility include:
  - Comparing competitors’ receivables as a percentage of sales with those of the company under analysis.
  - Examining customer concentration—risk increases when receivables are concentrated in one or a few customers.
  - Computing and investigating trends in the average collection period of receivables compared with customary credit terms for the industry.
  - Determining the portion of receivables that are renewals of prior accounts or notes receivable.
- ```Authenticity of Receivables;``` The description of receivables in financial statements or notes is usually insufficient to provide reliable clues as to whether receivables are genuine, due, and enforceable. Knowledge of industry practices and supplementary sources of information are used for added assurance.
  - One factor affecting authenticity is the right of merchandise return. Customers in certain industries, like the magazine, textbook, or toy industries, enjoy a substantial right of merchandise return. Our analysis must allow for return privileges. Liberal return privileges can impair quality of receivables.
- ```Securitization of Receivables;``` 
  - Another important analysis issue arises when a company sells all or a portion of its receivables to a third party which, typically, finances the sale by selling bonds to the capital markets. The collection of those receivables provides the source for the yield on the bond. **Such practice is called securitization**.
  - **The sale of receivables to a bank or commercial finance company is called factoring.**
  - Receivables can be kept off the balance sheet only when the company selling its receivables surrenders all control over the receivables to an independent buyer of sufficient financial strength. This means as long as a buyer has any type of recourse or the selling company has any degree of retained interest in the receivables, the company selling receivables has to continue to record both an asset and a compensating liability for the amount sold.
  - The securitization of receivables is often accomplished by establishing a special purpose entity (SPE) to purchase the receivables from the company and finance the purchase via sale of bonds into the market.


#### 1.1.3 Prepaid Expenses
- **Prepaid expenses** are advance payments for services or goods not yet received.
- Examples are advance payments for rent, insurance, utilities, and property taxes.
- Prepaid expenses usually are classified in current assets because they reflect services due that would otherwise require use of current assets.

#### 1.1.4 Inventory
- **Inventories** are goods held for sale as part of a company’s normal business operations. With the exception of certain service organizations, inventories are essential and important assets of companies.
- The **inventory equation** is useful in understanding inventory flows. For a merchandising company:
  - **Beginning inventories + Net purchases - Cost of goods sold = Ending inventories**

##### ```Flow of Costs```
- The costs of inventories are initially recorded on the balance sheet.
- As the inventories are sold, these costs are removed from the balance sheet and flow into the income statement as cost of goods sold (COGS).
- Costs cannot be in two places at the same time; either they remain on the balance sheet (as a future expense) or are recognized currently in the income statement and reduce profitability to match against sales revenue.
-  If all inventories acquired or manufactured during the period are sold, then COGS is equal to the cost of the goods purchased or manufactured. When inventories remain at the end of the accounting period, however, it is important to determine which inventories have been sold and which costs remain on the balance sheet.
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85560091/123995881-5e92d380-d994-11eb-9779-6e326c023e9d.png)
- There are **three GAAP options** in determining how to calculate COGS against sales; Let's consider next scenario:
```
Inventory on January 1, Year 2 40 units @ $500 each $20,000
Inventories purchased during the year 60 units @ $600 each 36,000
Cost of goods available for sale 100 units $56,000
```
- **"First-In, First-Out"**: This method assumes that the first units purchased are the first units sold;
```
Sales $24,000
COGS (30 @ $500 each) 15,000
Gross profit $ 9,000
```
- **"Last-In, First-Out"**: Under the LIFO inventory costing assumption, the last units purchased are the first to be sold; LIFO is not allowed under IFRS as a method for valuing inventories.
```
Sales $24,000
COGS (30 @ $500 each) 15,000
Gross profit $ 9,000
```
- **"Average Cost"**: COGS is computed as a weighted average of the total cost of goods available for sale divided by the number of units available for sale;
```
Sales $24,000
COGS (30 @ $560 each) 16,800
Gross profit $ 7,200
```
- The income statements under the three methods, then, are as follows:

Method | Sales | COGS | Gross Profit 
--- | --- | --- | --- 
FIFO | $24,000 | $15,000 | $9,000
LIFO | 24,000 | 18,000 | 6,000
Average cost |24,000 | 16,800 | 7,200

- **As the examples presented here highlight, gross profit can be affected by the company’s choice of its inventory costing method. In periods of rising prices, FIFO produces higher gross profits than LIFO because lower cost inventories are matched against sales revenues at current market prices. This is sometimes referred to as FIFO’s phantom profits as the gross profit is actually a sum of two components: an economic profit and a holding gain.**
  - The economic profit is equal to the number of units sold multiplied by the difference between the sales price and the replacement cost of the inventories
  - The holding gain is the increase in replacement cost since the inventories were acquired and is equal to the number of units sold multiplied by the difference between the current replacement cost and the original acquisition cost:

### 1.2 Long-term Assets
- The process of long-term asset accounting involves three distinct activities: **capitalization, allocation, and impairment**.
- **Capitalization** is the process of deferring a cost that is incurred in the current period, but whose benefits are expected to extend to one or more future periods. It is capitalization that creates an asset account.
- **Allocation** is the process of periodically expensing a deferred cost (asset) to one or more future expected benefit periods. This allocation process is called **depreciation** for tangible assets, **amortization** for intangible assets, and **depletion** for natural resource
- **Impairment** is the process of writing down the book value of the asset when its expected cash flows are no longer sufficient to recover the remaining cost reported on the balance sheet.

##### ```Capitalization```
- A long-term asset is created through the process of capitalization. 
- Capitalization means putting the asset on the balance sheet rather than immediately expensing its cost in the income statement
- For hard assets, such as PPE, this process is relatively simple; the asset is recorded at its purchase price

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grs-fK-YXgw
- *For soft assets such as R&D, advertising, and wage costs, capitalization is more problematic. Although all of these costs arguably produce future benefits and, therefore, meet the test to be recorded as an asset, neither the amount of the future benefits, nor their useful life, can be reliably measured*. **#TODO**

##### ```Allocation``` 
- Allocation is the periodic assignment of asset cost to expense over its expected useful life (benefit period). 
- Allocation of costs is called depreciation when applied to tangible fixed assets, amortization when applied to intangible assets, and depletion when applied to natural resources. 
- We must remember that cost allocation is a process to match asset cost with its benefits — it is not a valuation process. Asset carrying value (capitalized value less cumulative cost allocation) need not reflect fair value.
- Three factors determine the cost allocation amount: **useful life, salvage value, and allocation method**. 
- However, each of these factors requires estimates — estimates that involve managerial discretion. Analysis must consider the effects of these estimates on financial statements, especially when estimates change.

##### ``Impairment`` 
- When the expected (undiscounted) cash flows are less than the asset’s carrying amount (cost less accumulated depreciation), the asset is deemed to be impaired and is written down to its fair market value (the discounted amount of expected cash flows).
- The effect is to reduce the carrying amount of the asset on the balance sheet and to reduce profitability by a like amount. 
- The fair value of the asset, then, becomes the new cost and is depreciated over its remaining useful life. 
- **It is not written up if expected cash flows subsequently improve**. From our analysis perspective, two distortions arise from asset impairment:
  - 1. Conservative biases distort long-term asset valuation because assets are written down but not written up.
  - 2. Large transitory effects from recognizing asset impairments distort net income. Note that asset impairment is still an allocation process, not a move toward valuation. That is, an asset impairment is recorded when managers’ expectations of future cash inflows from the asset fall below carrying value. This yields an immediate write-off in a desire to better match future cost allocations with future benefits.

#### 1.2.1 Property, Plant, and Equipment
- **Property, plant, and equipment (or plant assets)** are noncurrent tangible assets used in the manufacturing, merchandising, or service processes to generate revenues and cash flows for more than one period.
  - "Property" refers to the cost of real estate
  - "Plant" refers to buildings and operating structures
  - "Equipment" refers to machinery used in operations
- *Property, Plant, and Equipment == PPE == assets == capital assets == fixed assets*

## II. Liabilities
- Liabilities are claims against the company by other businesses or its employees

### 2.1 Current Liabilities

#### 2.1.1 Accounts Payable
- Accounts payable includes money a company owes it vendors for services and products that it has purchased in the normal course of business and anticipates paying back in the short term.
- Note that the terms **accounts payable** and **trade payables** are often used synonymously. **Trade payables** generally refer to vendors from which a company buys business supplies and direct materials: items it uses to manufacture products for sale.

#### 2.1.2 Payroll and Taxes
- Most companies accrue payroll and related payroll taxes, which means the company owes them but has not yet paid them. 
  - This concept is easy to understand if you think about the way you’ve been paid by an employer in the past: Most companies have a built-in lag time between when employees earn their wages and when the paychecks are cut.
  - For example, Birchstone Manufacturing pays its employees on the 1st and 15th of every month with 15 days of wages in arrears. This means that when the employees get their paychecks on October 15, the paychecks compensate work they did from September 16 through September 30.

#### 2.1.3 Unearned Revenue
- **Unearned revenue** occurs when a company receives payment for goods or services rendered before it has actually provided the goods or services. Because the business has an obligation to fulfill its end of the contract, the unearned revenue is a current liability until the company completes its end of the transaction.
- *To record revenue, it has to be earned and realizable. Because the customer has already paid, the realizable part is a wrap. However, in this situation, the revenue is not yet earned*
- 
### 2.2 Long-term Liabilities

## III. Shareholders' Equity
- Equity refers to owner (shareholder) financing of a company
- It is viewed as reflecting the claims of owners on the net assets of the company
- Holders of equity securities are typically subordinate to creditors, meaning that creditors’ claims are settled first
- **Equity holders are exposed to the maximum risk associated with a company**Equity holders are exposed to the maximum risk associated with a company

### 3.1 Capital Stock
- **Capital stock** is the amount of common and preferred shares that a company is authorized to issue — recorded on the balance sheet under shareholders' equity
- **Capital stock** are shares issued to equity holders in return for assets and services. There are two basic types of capital stock: preferred and common
  - *Capital Stock*: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstock.asp
  - *Capital Stock*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ2uWgtQXBo
- The amount of capital stock is the maximum amount of shares that a company can ever have outstanding.
- **```CAPITAL STOCK IS NOT EQUAL TO "SHARES OUTSTANDING"```**
  - Authorized shares are those that a company is legally able to issue—the capital stock, while outstanding shares are those that have actually been issued and remain outstanding to shareholders.
  - The number of outstanding shares, which are shares issued to investors, is not necessarily equal to the number of available or authorized shares
  - *Shares Outstanding*: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp
- **```Contributed Capital or Paid-in Capital```**: is the total financing received from shareholders in return for capital shares. Contributed capital is usually divided into two parts:
  - One part is assigned to the **par or stated value** of capital shares: common and/or preferred stock (if stock is no-par, then it is assigned the total financing)
  - The remainder is reported as contributed (or paid-in) capital in excess of par or stated value (also called **additional paid-in capital**)
  - When combined, these accounts reflect the amounts paid in by shareholders for financing business activities 
- **```"Treasury Stock" or "Buybacks"```**
  - **Treasury stock (or buybacks)** are the shares of a company’s stock reacquired after having been previously issued and fully paid for. 
  - Acquisition of treasury stock by a company reduces both assets and shareholders’ equity
  - Consistent with this transaction, treasury stock is not an asset, it is a contra-equity account (negative equity). Treasury stock is typically recorded at cost, and the most common method of presentation is to deduct treasury stock cost from the total of shareholders’ equity. When companies record treasury stock at par, they typically report it as a contra to (reduction of ) its related class of stock. [???]

#### 3.1.1 Preffered Stock
- **Preferred stock** is a special class of stock possessing preferences or features not enjoyed by common stock. The more typical features attached to preferred stock include:
  - **Dividend distribution preferences** including participating and cumulative features
  - **Liquidation priorities**
  - **Convertibility (redemption) into common stock** — the SEC requires separate presentation of these shares when preferred stock possesses characteristics of debt (such as redemption requirements)
  - **Nonvoting rights** — which can change with changes in items such as arrearages in dividends
  - **Call provisions** — usually protecting preferred shareholders against premature redemption (call premiums often decrease over time) [???]
- *Preferred Stock*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwwwpie6NX8


#### 3.1.2 Common Stock
- **Common stock** is a class of stock representing ownership interest and bearing ultimate risks and rewards of company performance
- **Common stock represents residual interests** — having no preference, but reaping residual net income and absorbing net losses.
- There is sometimes more than one class of common stock for major companies. The distinctions between common stock classes typically are differences in dividend, voting, or other rights.
- *Common Stock*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaIJWGhjgnc
- *Common Stock vs. Additional Paid-in Capital*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GSdrqrbp8A

### 3.2 Retained Earnings
- Retained earnings are the earned capital of a company. The retained earnings account reflects the accumulation of undistributed earnings (net income) of a company since its inception.
- This contrasts with the capital stock and additional paid-in capital accounts that constitute capital contributed by shareholders.
- Retained earnings are the primary source of dividend distributions to shareholders:
  - *Cash Dividends*: A cash dividend is a distribution of cash to shareholders. It is the most common form of dividend and, once declared, is a liability of a company
  - Another form of dividend is the dividend in kind, or property dividend. These dividends are payable in the assets of a company, in goods, or in the stock of another corporation. Such dividends are valued at the market value of the assets distributed
 - A *stock dividend* is a distribution of a company’s own shares to shareholders on a pro rata basis. It represents, in effect, a permanent capitalization of earnings. Shareholders receive additional shares in return for reallocation of retained earnings to capital accounts.
