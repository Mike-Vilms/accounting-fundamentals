## Book Value
- Book value is conventional terminology referring to net asset value — that is, total assets reduced by claims against them
- The *book value of common stock* is equal to the total assets less liabilities and claims of securities senior to common stock (such as preferred stock) at amounts reported on the balance sheet (but can also include unbooked claims of senior securities)
- A simple means of computing book value is to add up the common stock equity accounts and reduce this total by any senior claims not reflected in the balance sheet (including preferred stock dividend arrearages, liquidation premiums, or other asset preferences to which preferred shares are entitled)
- **Book value per share** is the per share amount resulting from a company’s liquidation at amounts reported on its balance sheet

- Book value plays an important role in analysis of financial statements. Applications can include the following:
  - Book value, with potential adjustments, is frequently used in assessing merger terms.
  - Analysis of companies composed of mainly liquid assets (finance, investment, insurance, and banking institutions) relies extensively on book values.
  - Analysis of high-grade bonds and preferred stock attaches considerable importance to asset coverage.
- These applications must recognize the accounting considerations entering into the computation of book value per share such as the following:
  - Carrying values of assets, particularly long-lived assets like property, plant, and equipment, are usually reported at cost and can markedly differ from market values.
  - Internally generated intangible assets often are not reflected in book value, nor are contingent assets with a reasonable probability of occurrence.


## Enterprise Value
- Enterprise Value (EV) is the measure of a company’s total value. It looks at the entire market value rather than just the equity value, so all ownership interests and asset claims from both debt and equity are included. EV can be thought of as the effective cost of buying a company or the theoretical price of a target company (before a takeover premium is considered).
- **EV = MC + Total Debt − C**
  - *MC = Market capitalization; equal to the current stock price multiplied by the number of outstanding stock shares*
  - *Total debt = Equal to the sum of short-term and long-term debt*
  - *C = Cash and cash equivalents; the liquid assets of a company, but may not include marketable securities*
- **EV = Common Shares + Preferred Shares + Market Value of Debt + Minority Interest – Cash and Equivalents**
- Enterprise value (EV) could be thought of like the theoretical takeover price if a company were to be bought.
- The value of a firm's debt, for example, would need to be paid off by the buyer when taking over a company. As a result, enterprise value provides a much more accurate takeover valuation because it includes debt in its value calculation.

## Free Cash Flow
- Free cash flow (FCF) measures a company’s financial performance. It shows the cash that a company can produce after deducting the purchase of assets such as property, equipment, and other major investments from its operating cash flow. In other words, FCF measures a company’s ability to produce what investors care most about: cash that’s available to be distributed in a discretionary way.
- Formula: **Free Cash Flow = Cash Flow from Operations - Purchase of PP&E**
- Knowing the company’s free cash flow enables management to decide on future ventures that would improve the shareholder value. Additionally, having an abundant FCF indicates that a company is capable of paying its monthly dues. Companies can also use their FCF to expand business operations or pursue other short-term investments.
- Meanwhile, other entities looking to invest may likely consider companies that have a healthy free cash flow because of a promising future. Couple this with a low-valued share price, investors can generally make good investments with companies that have high FCF. Other investors greatly consider FCF compared to other measures because it also serves as an important basis for stock pricing.
- The company’s net income greatly affects a company’s free cash flow because it also influences a company’s ability to generate cash from operations. As such, other activities (i.e., those not within the core business operations of a company) from which the company generates income must be scrutinized deeply in order to reflect a more appropriate FCF value.
- On the investors’ side, they must be wary of a company’s policies that affect their declaration of FCF. For example, some companies lengthen the time to settle their debts to maintain cash or, the opposite, shortening the time they collect debts due to them. Companies also have different guidelines on which assets they declare as capital expenditures, thus affecting the computation of FCF.

## Net Present Value
- Net Present Value (NPV) is the value of all future cash flows (positive and negative) over the entire life of an investment discounted to the present. NPV analysis is a form of intrinsic valuation and is used extensively across finance and accounting for determining the value of a business, investment security, capital project, new venture, cost reduction program, and anything that involves cash flow.
- In most cases, a financial analyst needs to calculate the net present value of a series of cash flows, not just one individual cash flow.  The formula works in the same way, however, each cash flow has to be discounted individually, and then all of them are added together.
- Here is the mathematical formula for calculating the present value of an individual cash flow:
  - *NPV = F / [ (1 + i)^n ]*
  - *PV* = Present Value
  - *F* = Future payment (cash flow)
  - *i* = Discount rate (or interest rate)
  - *n* = the number of periods in the future the cash flow is

## Internal Rate of Return
- The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of a project zero. 
  - In other words, it is the expected compound annual rate of return that will be earned on a project or investment.

## Weighted Average Cost of Capital

## Depreciation
- Depreciation is the allocation of the costs of plant and equipment (land is not depreciated) over their useful lives
- Although added back in the statement of cash flows as a noncash expense, depreciation does not provide funds for replacement of an asset
- The *rate of depreciation* depends on two factors: useful life and allocation method
- **```Useful Life```**
  - Assumptions regarding useful lives of assets are based on economic conditions, engineering studies, experience, and information about an asset’s physical and productive properties
  - Physical deterioration is an important factor limiting useful life, and nearly all assets are subject to it. The frequency and quality of maintenance bear on physical deterioration
  - Another limiting factor is **obsolescence**, which impacts useful life through technological developments, consumption patterns, and economic forces
  - Ordinary obsolescence occurs when technological developments make an asset inefficient or uneconomical before its physical life is complete
  - Once the useful life of an asset is determined, periodic depreciation expense depends on the *allocation method*. Two most common classes of methods: *straight-line and accelerated*
#### ```Straight-line method of depreciation```
- The straight-line method of depreciation allocates the cost of an asset to its useful life on the basis of equal periodic charges
- The rationale for straight-line depreciation is the assumption that physical deterioration occurs uniformly over time
- This assumption is likely more valid for fixed structures such as buildings than for machinery where utilization is a more important factor
- Straight-line depreciation is used by approximately 85% of publicly traded companies for financial **reporting purposes**(accelerated methods of depreciation are used for tax returns as we discuss below)
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85560091/130537505-cbcba82f-0607-4f05-be9a-7a891215abde.png)
- Pros: simplicity
- Cons: 
  - Straight-line depreciation implicitly assumes that depreciation in early years is identical to that in later years when the asset is likely less efficient and requires increased maintenance
  - Another flaw with straight-line depreciation, and one of special interest for analysis, is the resulting distortion in rate of return
#### ```Accelerated-line method of depreciation```
- Accelerated methods of depreciation allocate the cost of an asset to its useful life in a decreasing manner
- Their appeal for tax purposes is the acceleration of cost allocation and the subsequent deferral of taxable income
- The **faster an asset is written off for tax purposes, the greater the tax deferral to future periods** and the more funds immediately available for operations
- The conceptual support for accelerated methods is the view that decreasing depreciation charges over time compensate for
  - Increasing repair and maintenance costs
  - Decreasing revenues and operating efficiency
  - Higher uncertainty of revenues in later years of aged assets (due to obsolescence).
- The two most common accelerated depreciation methods are *declining balance* and *sum of the years’ digits*
